# UI Inspiration Brief – Team Share

Hey team,

I’ve refreshed the reference packet in [`docs/ui_inspiration.md`](../ui_inspiration.md). Instead of storing large annotated PNGs in
`docs/assets/`, the brief now lists public links plus the exact callouts we’ll recreate in Figma. This keeps the repo lightweight
while still giving us concrete visuals to rally around.

Highlights covered:
- Mint (legacy dashboard hero, alert ribbon patterns)
- Monarch Money (gradient hero, trial CTA behavior, testimonials)
- Lunch Money (dense ledger layout, navigation rail interactions)
- Tiller (spreadsheet preview, dual CTA stack, integration badges)

The doc also distills typography, color, data density, and interaction takeaways with a proposed set of PocketSage design principles.
Please review and drop any comments in the doc or reply here so we can lock alignment on the principles before implementation kicks off.

Key questions to confirm:
1. Are we aligned on the “information hierarchy first” principle (large numeric typography + whitespace)?
2. Should our accent palette lean cooler (Mint/Tiller) or warmer (Lunch Money), or do we want dual modes?
3. Any additional interaction patterns we should scout before locking navigation wireframes?

Once I hear back, I’ll proceed with the implementation tasks based on the agreed direction.

Thanks!

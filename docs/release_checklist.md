# Release Checklist

## Packaging Setup
> - Desktop packaging via `flet pack`
>
> - `make package` → flet pack build

1. Ensure the working tree is clean and dependencies are installed (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`).
2. Run `make package` to invoke the Flet pack build and produce the desktop binary.
3. Verify the generated executable is present under `dist/` and launches without crashing.

## Packaging Acceptance Criteria
- The release artifact is a Flet **desktop** binary generated by the `make package` target.
- Supporting assets/config resolve correctly so the binary runs without additional setup.
- Build scripts produce platform-appropriate outputs (`PocketSage.exe`, `PocketSage.app`, or `dist/PocketSage/PocketSage`).

## Stakeholder Communication
- Update the stakeholder-facing release notes (`docs/release_notes.md`) with the current version, packaging status, and any known limitations.
- Highlight completion of the onefile packaging milestone and note outstanding TODOs or follow-up work.
- Circulate the updated release notes through the agreed channels (e.g., email, chat, or project hub) before publishing the release.

# Release Checklist

## Packaging Setup
> - PyInstaller onefile packaging
>
> - `make package` â†’ PyInstaller stub build

1. Ensure the working tree is clean and dependencies are installed, including PyInstaller (`pip install -e ".[dev]" && pip install pyinstaller`).
2. Run `make package` to invoke the PyInstaller stub build and produce the onefile binary.
3. Verify the generated executable is present under `out/` and launches without crashing.

## Packaging Acceptance Criteria
- The release artifact is a PyInstaller **onefile** binary generated by the `make package` target.
- Supporting assets (templates, static files, and configuration) are embedded or co-located so the binary runs without additional setup.
- The PyInstaller spec (`PocketSage.spec`) is updated if bundling requirements change.

## Stakeholder Communication
- Update the stakeholder-facing release notes (`docs/release_notes.md`) with the current version, packaging status, and any known limitations.
- Highlight completion of the onefile packaging milestone and note outstanding TODOs or follow-up work.
- Circulate the updated release notes through the agreed channels (e.g., email, chat, or project hub) before publishing the release.

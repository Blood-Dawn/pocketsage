# PocketSage Manual Test Plan

## Liabilities Blueprint
- [ ] Visit `/liabilities/` from the running development server.
  - âœ… Confirm the placeholder paragraph still renders with the `TODO(@debts-squad)` note about payoff strategy visualizations.
  - ðŸ“Ž Capture a screenshot if the placeholder is replaced with production-ready content and update QA notes accordingly.

## Notes
- The liabilities overview currently shows the TODO placeholder in the UI, so no QA note updates are required at this time.
